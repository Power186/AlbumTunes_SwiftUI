# AlbumTunes_SwiftUI
iOS App: AlbumTunes - get the top US 100 albums/songs in iTunes. Go to album in iTunes Store and preview the song.

## Note:
In the simulator there is no Music app (iTunes app) like a real device, so that's why it displays that alert when going to an album in the store.  On a real device it opens the album with songs displayed in the Music app by Apple with no alert like shown below.
